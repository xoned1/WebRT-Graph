# WebRT-Graph
WebRT-Graph is web-application to analyze graph-networks.

### WebRT let's you:

* **Import** JSON, XML & CSV files or text
* **Edit** Graph (add & remove nodes and links, change the style)
* **Export** the graph as JSON or as Image

The webapplication is user based. You can create your own account and share it with your friends or colleagues.
Some features can directly synced or updated if a shared graph changes.
